4. Customize guidelines for your project

### Step 2: Team Onboarding
1. Review Nexus principles with team
2. Explain unlimited questioning approach
3. Demonstrate TDD workflow
4. Practice with example feature

### Step 3: Pipeline Configuration
1. Map existing workflow to Nexus phases
2. Identify phase transition points
3. Set up backward navigation rules
4. Configure parallel execution opportunities

### Step 4: Agent Configuration
1. Review available agents
2. Customize triggers for your context
3. Create project-specific agents if needed
4. Test agent invocations

### Step 5: Pattern Library Setup
1. Import existing patterns
2. Configure pattern detection thresholds
3. Set up pattern categories
4. Initialize pattern templates

### Step 6: Evolution Configuration
1. Set evolution trigger thresholds
2. Configure metric collection

```bash
# Before starting feature
/nexus-brainstorm "feature description"
/nexus-specify

# During development
/nexus-decompose
/nexus-implement

# Before PR
/nexus-validate
```

### With CI/CD Pipeline
- Pre-commit: Run guideline checks
- PR creation: Include specification links
- Post-merge: Trigger micro-evolution
- Release: Formal evolution reflection

### With Project Management
- Epic planning → BRAINSTORM phase
- Story creation → SPECIFY phase
- Sprint planning → DECOMPOSE phase
- Daily standups → Task state updates
- Retrospectives → EVOLVE phase

## Common Integration Patterns

### Greenfield Project

2. Full pipeline from BRAINSTORM
3. Let patterns emerge naturally
4. Evolution from day one

### Legacy Project
1. Gradual phase adoption
2. Start with SPECIFY for new features
3. Retrofit patterns from existing code
4. Incremental guideline adoption

### Emergency Hotfix

# Nexus Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Commands Not Recognized
**Symptom**: `/nexus-*` commands not working in Claude

**Solution**:
1. Verify `.claude/commands/` directory exists
2. Check command files have correct format
3. Restart Claude if needed
4. Ensure commands have proper markdown structure

### Issue: Agents Not Triggering
**Symptom**: Expected agents not activating

**Solution**:
1. Check agent trigger conditions
2. Verify Task tool invocation syntax
3. Review agent specification format
4. Test with explicit agent invocation

### Issue: Evolution Not Capturing Patterns
**Symptom**: Patterns not being extracted despite repetition

**Solution**:
1. Verify threshold settings (default: 3 repetitions)
2. Check pattern detection is enabled
3. Review `.nexus/evolution/continuous/patterns.log`
4. Manually trigger pattern extraction if needed

### Issue: Backward Phase Navigation Not Working
**Symptom**: Can't jump back to previous phases

**Solution**:
1. Check phase state tracking
2. Verify navigation rules configured
3. Ensure context preserved
4. Review decision log for blockers

### Issue: Parallel Tasks Conflicting
**Symptom**: Tasks marked [P] causing conflicts

**Solution**:
1. Review dependency mapping
2. Check resource requirements
3. Verify tasks are truly independent
4. Implement conflict resolution

### Issue: Guidelines Too Restrictive
**Symptom**: Development slowed by guidelines

**Solution**:
1. Review and adjust guidelines
2. Add documented exceptions
3. Capture in evolution feedback
4. Update based on team needs

### Issue: Questions Never Ending
**Symptom**: Questioning phase seems infinite

**Solution**:
Remember: This is BY DESIGN
1. Focus questions on understanding
2. Answer comprehensively
3. Provide concrete examples
4. Trust the process - clarity will emerge

## Performance Issues

### Slow Pattern Detection
- Reduce pattern complexity
- Optimize search scope
- Increase detection intervals
- Cache frequently accessed patterns

### Large Evolution Reports
- Archive old reports
- Summarize micro-evolutions
- Focus on key metrics
- Implement report pagination

## Methodology Adoption Issues

### Team Resistance to TDD
1. Start with small features
2. Demonstrate value with metrics
3. Allow spike exceptions
4. Celebrate test-first wins

### Overwhelming Question Volume
1. Create FAQ documents
2. Build question templates
3. Batch similar questions
4. Focus on critical understanding

### Pattern Library Overwhelming
1. Categorize effectively
2. Archive unused patterns
3. Regular library cleanup
4. Focus on high-value patterns

# Example Nexus Workflows

## Example 1: New Feature Development

### Scenario
Adding user authentication to web application

### Workflow Execution

#### 1. BRAINSTORM Phase
```bash
/nexus-brainstorm "user authentication system"
```

Questions asked:
- What authentication methods? (email/password, OAuth, 2FA?)
- Session management approach? (JWT, sessions, cookies?)
- Password requirements? (complexity, expiration?)
- Account recovery process? (email, SMS, security questions?)

Output: `.nexus/brainstorms/2025-09-18-auth.md`

#### 2. SPECIFY Phase
```bash
/nexus-specify "user authentication"
```

Created specifications:
- Functional requirements with test criteria
- API endpoint definitions
- Data model for users and sessions
- Security requirements

Output: `.nexus/specs/auth/specification.md`

#### 3. DESIGN Phase
```bash
/nexus-design "authentication"
```

Architecture decisions:
- JWT for stateless auth
- Bcrypt for password hashing
- Redis for session storage
- Rate limiting strategy

Output: `.nexus/design/auth/architecture.md`

#### 4. DECOMPOSE Phase
```bash
/nexus-decompose
```

Tasks created:
- [S] T001: Write auth service tests
- [M] T002: Implement auth service
- [S] T003: Write password validation tests
- [XS] T004: Implement password validation
- [P][S] T005: Write session tests
- [P][S] T006: Write rate limiter tests

Output: `.nexus/tasks/auth-tasks.md`

#### 5. IMPLEMENT Phase
```bash
/nexus-implement T001
# RED: Write failing test
# Get approval
# GREEN: Implement minimal code
# REFACTOR: Improve structure
```

Pattern detected: Error handling repeated 3x
Extracted to: `.nexus/patterns/code/auth-error-handling.md`

#### 6. VALIDATE Phase
```bash
/nexus-validate
```

Results:
- Tests: 100% passing
- Coverage: 87%
- Security: No vulnerabilities
- Guidelines: 100% compliance

Output: `.nexus/validation/auth-report.md`

#### 7. EVOLVE Phase
```bash
/nexus-evolve
```

Learnings:
- Auth pattern valuable for reuse
- Session management questions recurring
- Need specialized auth-test agent

Output: `.nexus/evolution/2025-09-18-reflection.md`

## Example 2: Bug Fix Workflow

### Scenario
Critical production bug in payment processing

### Workflow Execution

#### Fast Track with TDD Exception
```bash
# Document emergency
echo "Emergency: Payment bug affecting production" > .nexus/decision-log.md

# Jump directly to IMPLEMENT
/nexus-implement --emergency

# Fix with temporary exception
# Document: "Tests to be added within 24 hours"

# Within 24 hours
/nexus-brainstorm "payment bug root cause"
/nexus-specify "payment validation rules"
/nexus-implement --add-tests
/nexus-validate
```

## Example 3: Refactoring Workflow

### Scenario
Refactoring legacy code to patterns

### Workflow Execution

#### Start from DESIGN
```bash
# Understand existing code
/nexus-design --analyze-existing

# Identify patterns
# SecurityGuardian reviews for vulnerabilities
# Pattern detector finds repeated structures

# Decompose refactoring
/nexus-decompose --refactor

# Tasks include:
# - Write tests for existing behavior
# - Refactor to patterns
# - Validate no regression

# Pattern library grows
# Evolution captures refactoring patterns
