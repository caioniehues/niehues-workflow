### Constitutional Framework
- **Principle I**: Test-Driven Development enforcement (immutable)
- **Principle II**: Question Everything, Assume Nothing (confidence ≥85%)
- **Principle III**: Context Preservation (audit trail required)
- **Principle IV**: Interactive Validation (human oversight)
- **Principle V**: Quality Gates (automated validation)

### Core Components
- `CommandHandler`: Base class for all CLI commands
- `NexusInitCommand`: Project initialization with constitutional setup
- `SqliteContextManager`: Context management with TTL support

- `BrainstormFormatter`: Adaptive questioning and result formatting
- Constitutional validation system
- Quality gate framework
- Agent context sharing system

### Technical Features
- TypeScript strict mode with full type safety

- ESLint with TypeScript parser
- Development workflow with watch mode
- Build system with clean scripts
- Coverage reporting configuration
- Git integration preparation

### Documentation Structure
- README.md with comprehensive overview
- Technical specification (v4.0.0)
- Installation and usage instructions

## Technical Debt and Improvements

### Known Limitations (v0.1.0)
- Brainstorm phase partially implemented (interactive questioning placeholder)
- Specify phase awaiting full agent integration
- Decompose phase needs task estimation refinement
- Implement phase TDD enforcement needs file system monitoring
- Limited error recovery mechanisms
- Basic logging without structured formats
- No integration with external IDEs
- Limited customization options

### Performance Considerations
- SQLite single-writer limitation for high concurrency
- Context serialization overhead for large objects
- Memory usage optimization needed for long-running sessions
- Database query optimization for complex context queries

### Security Considerations
- Input validation strengthening needed
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries implemented)
- File system access security review required
- Session token security implementation pending

## Breaking Changes

### v0.1.0 (Initial Release)
- No breaking changes (initial version)

## Migration Guide

### From Development to v0.1.0
For developers who worked with early development versions:

1. **Database Schema**: Initialize fresh database with `nexus init --force`
2. **Configuration**: Update `.nexus/config.yaml` format if customized
3. **Context Format**: Existing context may need regeneration
4. **Command Interface**: Verify command arguments haven't changed
