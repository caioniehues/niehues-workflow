# Nexus Enhanced Workflow - Claude Code Commands

A comprehensive workflow methodology for Claude Code, implementing constitutional TDD enforcement with progressive context embedding and specialized agent architecture.

## Overview

This repository contains Claude Code markdown commands and documentation for the Nexus Enhanced Workflow - a quality-first development methodology that combines:

- **Constitutional TDD principles** - Immutable rules enforcing test-driven development
- **Progressive context embedding** - Smart adaptive context management (200-2000 lines)
- **Specialized agent roles** - Hard boundaries preventing role violations
- **Unlimited adaptive questioning** - No limits until 85% confidence achieved
- **6-phase pipeline** - Brainstorm → Specify → Decompose → Implement → Validate → Deploy

## Claude Code Commands

Available commands in `.claude/commands/`:

### `/nexus-init`
Initialize a new Nexus workflow project with constitutional framework and foundation templates.

### `/nexus-brainstorm`
Generate 20+ diverse creative approaches for any problem, categorized as conventional, innovative, experimental, and hybrid.

### `/nexus-specify`
Create detailed specifications from brainstorm results using SRS templates.

### `/nexus-shard`
Break large specifications into manageable shards (<500 lines) with epic/story/task hierarchy.

### `/nexus-decompose`
Transform specifications into atomic, self-contained tasks with embedded context.

### `/nexus-implement`
Begin TDD-enforced implementation with constitutional blocking on test violations.

### `/nexus-validate`
Run comprehensive validation including constitutional compliance, performance benchmarks, and security audits.

## Key Innovations

1. **Context Embedding**: Every task contains ALL needed context (no external lookups required)
2. **Document Sharding**: Automatic breakdown of specs into <500 line manageable chunks
3. **Hard Agent Boundaries**: Agents physically cannot violate their designated roles
4. **Constitutional TDD**: System blocks any code without tests (not a suggestion, but enforcement)
5. **Unlimited Questioning**: Continues asking until 85% confidence is achieved

## Workflow Philosophy

The Nexus Enhanced Workflow enforces quality through:
- **Constitutional principles** that cannot be overridden
- **Progressive refinement** through unlimited adaptive questioning
- **Context preservation** maintaining all decisions and rationale
- **Hard boundaries** preventing shortcuts or quality compromises

## Getting Started

1. Use `/nexus-init` to establish your project's constitutional framework
2. Use `/nexus-brainstorm` to generate creative approaches
3. Use `/nexus-specify` to create detailed specifications
4. Use `/nexus-shard` if specifications exceed 500 lines
5. Use `/nexus-decompose` to create self-contained tasks
6. Use `/nexus-implement` with TDD enforcement
7. Use `/nexus-validate` for comprehensive quality checks

## Success Metrics

- **Sharding**: 70% size reduction in specification chunks
- **Context lookups**: 60% reduction through embedding
- **Implementation time**: 30% reduction
- **First-pass success**: 90% target
- **TDD compliance**: 100% (constitutional enforcement)
