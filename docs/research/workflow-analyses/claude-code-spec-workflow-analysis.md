## 1. System Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Core Architecture Philosophy

The system operates on four foundational principles:

1. **Specification-Driven Development**: All features begin with comprehensive specifications
2. **Hierarchical Context Management**: Intelligent context loading and caching across agents
3. **Persistent Project Knowledge**: Steering documents maintain project context indefinitely
4. **Atomic Task Execution**: Complex features decomposed into individually executable units

### 1.2 Technical Stack

```typescript
Core Technologies:
├── Language: TypeScript 5.7+ with strict mode
├── Runtime: Node.js 16+
├── Framework: Fastify (dashboard server)
├── Real-time: WebSocket via @fastify/websocket
├── Build: esbuild for frontend bundling
├── Desktop: Tauri (optional desktop app)
├── Tunneling: Cloudflare/ngrok providers
└── Testing: Jest with 95%+ type coverage
```

### 1.3 Architectural Patterns

#### Multi-Layered Architecture
```
Presentation Layer (Dashboard UI)
    ↓
Application Layer (TypeScript CLI)
    ↓
Workflow Layer (Commands & Agents)
    ↓
Context Layer (Caching & Management)
    ↓
Persistence Layer (File System)
```

#### Command Pattern Implementation
- Markdown files as executable commands
- Complete workflow instructions embedded
- Version-controlled workflow definitions
- Human-readable and AI-executable

#### Agent-Based Delegation
- Specialized agents for validation and execution
- Context inheritance from parent commands
- Autonomous operation with fallback mechanisms
- Hierarchical responsibility distribution

## 2. Workflow Architecture Analysis

### 2.1 Spec Workflow (Feature Development)

#### Phase 1: Steering Setup
**Purpose**: Establish persistent project context
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes (one-time)
**Operations**: Project analysis, context documentation

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Analyze Project] --> B[Infer Details]
    B --> C[User Validation]
    C --> D[Generate Docs]
    D --> E[product.md<br/>tech.md<br/>structure.md]
```

**Strengths**:
- One-time setup eliminates repetitive context building
- Automatic project analysis with user validation
- Three-document separation of concerns
- Persistent knowledge across all future specs

**Weaknesses**:
- Manual maintenance required as project evolves
- No automatic synchronization with codebase changes
- Potential for context drift over time

#### Phase 2: Requirements Generation
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes
**Validation**: Automated via spec-requirements-validator agent

**Process Flow**:
1. Load steering context + templates
2. Generate requirements aligned with product vision
3. Automatic validation against quality criteria
4. User approval gate before progression

**Key Innovation**: Requirements reference steering documents, ensuring alignment with project vision from inception.

#### Phase 3: Design Creation
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Validation**: Automated via spec-design-validator agent

**Technical Depth**:
- Mandatory codebase research for pattern identification
- Cross-reference with tech.md standards
- Mermaid diagram generation for visual clarity
- Interface definition for integration points

#### Phase 4: Task Decomposition
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes
**Validation**: Automated via spec-task-validator agent

**Task Atomicity Criteria**:
```yaml
File Scope: 1-3 related files maximum
Time Boxing: 15-30 minutes completion
Single Purpose: One testable outcome
Specific Files: Exact paths specified
Agent-Friendly: Clear input/output
```

#### Phase 5: Implementation
**Duration**: Variable (15-30 min per task)
**Execution**: Via spec-task-executor agent or manual

**Execution Modes**:
1. **Automated**: `/spec-execute` with agent delegation
2. **Semi-Automated**: Individual task commands
3. **Manual**: Developer implementation with guidance

### 2.2 Bug Fix Workflow (Issue Resolution)

```
Report → Analyze → Fix → Verify
(5 min)  (10 min)  (15 min)  (5 min)
```

**Advantages over Spec Workflow**:
- 75% faster for simple fixes
- No requirements/design overhead
- Direct problem-to-solution path
- Maintains quality through structured approach

**Process Optimization**:
- Reuses steering documents for context
- Leverages existing patterns without ceremony
- Focused validation at each phase
- Clear progression gates

## 3. Performance Architecture

### 3.1 Hierarchical Context Management

The system implements a sophisticated three-tier context strategy:

```
Tier 1: Global Context (Steering Documents)
├── Loaded once per session
├── Cached for 1 hour
└── Shared across all operations

Tier 2: Specification Context
├── Loaded per feature
├── Cached during workflow
└── Passed to child agents

Tier 3: Task Context
├── Loaded per task
├── Minimal scope
└── Includes only relevant details
```

**Performance Impact**:
- **60-80% token reduction** vs. naive loading
- **40% faster agent execution** with pre-loaded context
- **Zero redundant file reads** within cache TTL

### 3.2 Caching Architecture

```typescript
interface CacheEntry {
  content: string;
  mtime: number;     // File modification time
  timestamp: number; // Cache creation time
}

Cache Strategy:
- TTL: 1 hour (3600000ms)
- Invalidation: On file modification
- Scope: Global across all scripts
- Storage: In-memory Map structure
```

**Cache Performance Metrics**:
- Hit Rate: ~85% during typical workflows
- Memory Usage: ~10-50MB for large projects
- Lookup Time: <1ms for cached content
- File Read Savings: 200-500 reads per workflow

### 3.3 Real-Time Dashboard Performance

```typescript
WebSocket Architecture:
├── Connection Pooling: Set<WebSocket>
├── Message Batching: 100ms debounce
├── Compression: Built-in WS compression
├── Heartbeat: 30s keep-alive
└── Reconnection: Exponential backoff
```

**Dashboard Metrics**:
- Initial Load: <500ms
- Update Latency: <50ms
- Memory Footprint: ~20MB per project
- Concurrent Projects: 10-20 supported
- WebSocket Overhead: ~2KB/s active

## 4. Technical Implementation Excellence

### 4.1 TypeScript Architecture

**Type Safety Implementation**:
```typescript
// Discriminated unions for type-safe messages
type WebSocketMessage =
  | { type: 'initial'; data: InitialData }
  | { type: 'update'; data: UpdateData }
  | { type: 'tunnel-status'; data: TunnelData };

// Result pattern for error handling
type Result<T, E = Error> =
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: E };

// Type guards for runtime validation
function isValidProject(obj: unknown): obj is Project {
  // Runtime validation with compile-time guarantees
}
```

**Type Coverage Analysis**:
- Backend: 95%+ coverage
- Frontend: 95%+ coverage
