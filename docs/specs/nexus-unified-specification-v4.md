# Nexus Unified Specification v4.0.0
**Date:** 2025-09-17
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Complete Working System
**Supersedes:** All previous versions (v1.0.0, v2.0.0, v3.0.0)
**Implementation:** Simple, practical approach - guaranteed to work

---

## Executive Summary

This document represents the definitive Nexus workflow specification, resolving all version conflicts through interactive synthesis. The unified system combines constitutional TDD enforcement, progressive context embedding, specialized agent architecture, and comprehensive validation in a 6-phase pipeline.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Constitutional Framework**: 5 immutable principles (context preservation + interactive validation as constitutional law)
- **Pipeline Architecture**: 6-phase workflow with dedicated VALIDATE phase
- **Context Management**: Progressive Context Embedding (core context embedded + reference links)
- **Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents with hard role boundaries
- **Implementation Timeline**: 8-12 weeks for full feature implementation

## Part 1: Constitutional Framework (DEFINITIVE)

### Immutable Principles (Cannot Be Changed)

```yaml
constitution:
  version: 4.0.0
  ratified: 2025-09-17
  status: DEFINITIVE

  immutable_principles:
    I:
      title: "Test-Driven Development"
      rules:
        - Tests MUST be written before implementation
        - Red-Green-Refactor cycle is mandatory
        - No production code without failing test first
        - Test coverage minimum: 80%
        - Every bug fix starts with a failing test

    II:
      title: "Question Everything, Assume Nothing"
      rules:
        - Every ambiguity requires clarification
        - No implicit decisions allowed
        - Confidence threshold must exceed 85%
        - Stop immediately on uncertainty
        - Document all assumptions explicitly

    III:
      title: "Quality Through Convergence"
      rules:
        - Multiple approaches analyzed when confidence < 70%
        - Best solution selected through comparison
        - Trade-offs explicitly documented
        - Decision rationale preserved

    IV:
      title: "Context Is Sacred"
      rules:
        - Every task must have embedded context
        - Context must be versioned and traceable
        - No implementation without complete context
        - Context inheritance from previous tasks
        - Source references mandatory

    V:
      title: "Interactive Validation Is Mandatory"
      rules:
        - Every major decision requires human confirmation
        - Present options one at a time for clarity
        - No batch processing of critical choices
        - Stop and ask when confidence < 85%
        - Celebrate collaboration over automation
```
