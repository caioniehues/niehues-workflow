## Decisions

### 001 - Adopt Nexus Enhanced Workflow
**Date**: {{initial_date}}
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: {{initial_deciders}}
**Technical Area**: Process

#### Context
The project needs a robust, scalable development workflow that ensures quality, maintains context, and enables rapid development while preventing technical debt accumulation.

#### Options Considered
1. **Traditional Agile/Scrum**: Standard sprint-based development
   - Pros: Well-understood, simple, flexible
   - Cons: Lacks enforcement mechanisms, context often lost, quality varies

2. **Nexus Enhanced Workflow**: TDD-first with constitutional enforcement
   - Pros: Enforced quality, preserved context, reduced rework, learning system
   - Cons: Initial setup complexity, learning curve, rigid structure

3. **Hybrid Approach**: Partial adoption of Nexus principles
   - Pros: Gradual adoption, less disruption
   - Cons: Inconsistent benefits, enforcement gaps

#### Decision
Adopt the full Nexus Enhanced Workflow with constitutional enforcement, mandatory TDD, and context preservation systems.

#### Consequences
- **Positive**: Consistent quality, reduced bugs, faster long-term velocity, knowledge preservation
- **Negative**: Initial slowdown during adoption, requires team buy-in, tooling investment needed

#### Implementation
1. Initialize workflow with /nexus-init command
2. Train team on TDD principles and workflow phases
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline with constitutional enforcement
4. Establish metrics tracking from day one

### 002 - Test-Driven Development as Constitutional Requirement
**Date**: {{initial_date}}
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: {{initial_deciders}}
**Technical Area**: Testing

#### Context
Code quality and maintainability are critical for long-term project success. Traditional "test after" approaches often lead to insufficient coverage and hard-to-test code.

#### Options Considered
1. **Optional TDD**: Developers choose when to write tests first
   - Pros: Flexibility, faster initial development
   - Cons: Inconsistent quality, coverage gaps, technical debt

2. **Mandatory TDD with Enforcement**: Constitutional requirement with automated blocking
   - Pros: Consistent quality, better design, comprehensive coverage
   - Cons: Initial resistance, learning curve, perceived slowdown

3. **Test Coverage Requirements Only**: Mandate coverage percentage without TDD
   - Pros: Measurable target, some flexibility
   - Cons: Gaming possible, quality not guaranteed

#### Decision
Make TDD a constitutional requirement with automated enforcement that blocks code without tests.

#### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Forces better design thinking
  - Comprehensive test coverage from start
  - Reduced debugging time
  - Living documentation through tests
- **Negative**:
  - Initial development feels slower
  - Requires discipline and training
  - May frustrate developers initially

#### Implementation
- ConstitutionalEnforcer blocks commits without tests
- Pre-commit hooks validate test existence
- CI/CD pipeline enforces {{test_coverage_min}}% coverage
- Team training on TDD principles

### 003 - Context Embedding in Task Files
**Date**: {{initial_date}}
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: {{initial_deciders}}
**Technical Area**: Architecture

#### Context
Developers waste significant time gathering context when starting tasks. External references lead to broken links, outdated information, and increased cognitive load.

#### Options Considered
1. **External Documentation**: Traditional separate documentation
   - Pros: Centralized, single source of truth
   - Cons: Often outdated, context switching required, links break

2. **Embedded Context**: {{min_context_lines}}-{{max_context_lines}} lines embedded in each task
   - Pros: Self-contained tasks, no external lookups, context preserved
   - Cons: Potential duplication, larger task files, sync challenges

3. **Hybrid with Smart Linking**: Minimal context with smart links
   - Pros: Smaller files, some context preservation
   - Cons: Still requires lookups, links can break

#### Decision
Embed {{min_context_lines}}-{{max_context_lines}} lines of adaptive context directly in task files, with smart expansion based on confidence levels.

#### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Tasks are self-contained
  - Reduced context switching (60% target reduction)
  - Faster task startup
  - Context travels with task through pipeline
- **Negative**:
  - Larger task files
  - Potential for context drift
  - Storage overhead

#### Implementation
- ContextEmbedder class with adaptive algorithm
- Smart context extraction from specifications
- Confidence-based expansion (more context when confidence low)
- Context inheritance from previous tasks

### 004 - Document Sharding for Specifications
**Date**: {{initial_date}}
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: {{initial_deciders}}
**Technical Area**: Architecture

#### Context
Large specification documents (>500 lines) are difficult to review, understand, and maintain. Cognitive overload leads to missed requirements and implementation errors.

#### Options Considered
1. **Monolithic Specifications**: Single large document per feature
   - Pros: Everything in one place, single source of truth
   - Cons: Cognitive overload, hard to review, difficult to navigate

2. **Hierarchical Sharding**: Epic → Story → Task breakdown
   - Pros: Manageable chunks, clear hierarchy, easier review
   - Cons: More files, potential fragmentation, navigation complexity

3. **Topic-Based Splitting**: Split by technical area
   - Pros: Logical grouping, expertise-based review
   - Cons: Cross-cutting concerns difficult, integration challenges

#### Decision
Implement hierarchical sharding with automatic breaking of specifications into <500 line chunks organized as Epic → Story → Task.

#### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - 70% reduction in specification size
  - Easier parallel work
  - Improved review quality
  - Better cognitive load management
- **Negative**:
  - More files to manage
  - Need for shard navigation
  - Potential context fragmentation

#### Implementation
- DocumentSharder class with intelligent breaking
- Maintains relationships between shards
- Automatic cross-referencing
- Shard reassembly for full view
