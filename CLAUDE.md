# Nexus Enhanced Workflow Implementation - Task Creation Session

## Current Task
Creating comprehensive STM tasks for the Nexus Enhanced Workflow implementation - a system that combines Nexus's TDD-first philosophy with BMAD-METHOD's context preservation innovations.

## Key Specifications
- **Main Spec**: `docs/specs/nexus-unified-specification-v4.md` - DEFINITIVE unified specification (single source of truth)
- **Archived Specs**: `docs/specs/archive/` - Superseded documents (for historical reference only)
- **Task Tracking**: `tracking/nexus-enhanced-tasks.yaml` - 85 tasks across 5 phases
- **Implementation Timeline**: 8-12 weeks for full feature implementation

## Implementation Strategy
Creating STM tasks with COMPLETE implementation details (not summaries). Each task must contain:
- Full code implementations (copied verbatim, not referenced)
- Complete technical requirements
- Detailed acceptance criteria
- All test scenarios

Using temp files for large content to preserve formatting:
```bash
cat > /tmp/task-details.txt << 'EOF'
[Full implementation code and details]
EOF

stm add "[Task Name]" \
  --description "Brief what and why" \
  --details "$(cat /tmp/task-details.txt)" \
  --validation "Complete acceptance criteria" \
  --tags "appropriate,tags" \
  --deps "dependencies"
```

### Directory Structure Created
```
.nexus/{constitution,brainstorms,specs/{monolithic,sharded/{epics,stories}},tasks,patterns,templates,metrics}
src/{engine/{constitution,context,agents,sharding,metrics,questioning,learning},pipeline,validation,types}
tests/{unit,integration,e2e}
.claude/{commands,agents}
docs/{examples,architecture,api}
```

### Files Created
- `src/types/constitution.ts` - Constitutional type definitions

## Implementation Progress by Phase

### Phase 1: Foundation & Constitutional Framework - ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Constitutional enforcement with TDD-first blocking
- ✅ Foundation templates (constitution.md, project-dna.md, decision-log.md)
- ✅ All pipeline commands (/nexus-brainstorm, /nexus-specify, /nexus-shard, /nexus-decompose, /nexus-implement)

### Phase 2: Context System & Document Sharding - ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ DocumentSharder: Breaks specs into <500 line shards
- ✅ ContextEmbedder: Smart adaptive context (200-2000 lines based on confidence)
- ✅ Context inheritance from previous tasks
- ✅ Task files with embedded context (no external lookups needed)

### Phase 3: Agent Specialization - ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Hard boundaries preventing role violations
- ✅ All specialized agents: SpecificationMaster, TestArchitect, ImplementationEngineer, ShardSpecialist, QualityGuardian
- ✅ Agent orchestration and coordination
- ⚠️ TDD enforcement engine integration (may need verification)

### Phase 4: Intelligence & Learning - 🚧 70% COMPLETED
- ✅ Unlimited adaptive questioning (AdaptiveQuestioningEngine)
- ✅ Pattern extraction and storage (PatternLearningEngine)
- ✅ Workflow metrics collection (WorkflowMetrics)
- ✅ Confidence calculation and edge case detection
- 🚧 Pending: SmartDefaults, DecisionLogger

### Phase 5: Validation & Production - 🚧 20% COMPLETED
- ✅ Constitutional compliance audit (ConstitutionalValidator)
- 🚧 Pending: Performance benchmarking, Security audit, Production readiness validation

## Key Innovations to Implement

1. **Context Embedding**: Every task contains ALL needed context (200-2000 lines adaptive)
2. **Document Sharding**: Specs broken into epic/story/task hierarchy (<500 lines each)
3. **Hard Agent Boundaries**: Agents physically cannot violate their roles
4. **Constitutional TDD**: System blocks any code without tests
5. **Unlimited Questioning**: No limits until 85% confidence achieved

## Important Implementation Details

### Constitutional Enforcement Pattern
```typescript
// Always blocks execution on violations
private blockViolation(violation: ConstitutionalViolation): never {
  console.error(`🛑 CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION DETECTED`);
  throw new Error(`Constitutional violation: ${violation.description}`);
}
```

### Context Embedding Structure
```yaml
embedded_context:
  core_context: # Always included (200-500 lines)
    - direct_requirements
    - acceptance_criteria
    - immediate_dependencies
  extended_context: # If confidence < 85% (500-1000 lines)
    - related_patterns
    - historical_decisions
    - edge_cases
  reference_context: # Links only
    - full_specification
    - architecture_docs
```

### Success Criteria Targets
- Sharding: 70% size reduction
- Context lookups: 60% reduction
- Implementation time: 30% reduction
- First-pass success: 90%
- TDD compliance: 100% (constitutional)

## Session Context
- Using STM (Simple Task Master) for task management
- Tasks must be self-contained with full implementations
- No summaries or references - actual code must be included
- Using temporary files for large content to preserve formatting
- Following the claudekit guidelines for proper STM task creation

## Current Implementation Instructions

### Task Status Check:
```bash
# Check task completion status
stm list --format json | jq -r '.[] | "\(.id): \(.status) - \(.title)"' | grep -E "(pending|in_progress)"

# Count completed vs pending
echo "Completed: $(stm list --format json | jq -r '.[] | .status' | grep -c done)"
echo "Pending: $(stm list --format json | jq -r '.[] | .status' | grep -c pending)"
```

### Implementation Priority:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Start with Task 27 (SmartDefaults) - Critical for Phase 4 completion
2. **HIGH**: Tasks 29, 32-35 (Core validation systems)
3. **MEDIUM**: Tasks 39-42 (Infrastructure integration)
4. **LOW**: Advanced features and enterprise systems

### Implementation Approach:
- All 86 tasks are created with full implementation details
- Focus on actual code implementation and testing
- Verify integration with existing completed components
- Maintain constitutional compliance throughout
- Use the existing task details as implementation blueprints

### Success Metrics:
- 32/86 tasks completed (37% done)
- Phases 1-3 fully completed ✅
- Phase 4: 70% completed 🚧
- Phase 5: 20% completed 🚧
- **Target**: 90%+ completion for production readiness
